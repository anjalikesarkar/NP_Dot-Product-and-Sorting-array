# Overview
## Array dot product
- Creating random integer arrays to represent the selling count of products (butters) and their respective prices.
- Creating DataFrames to structure the data using pandas.
- Performing a dot product operation between two arrays (selling counts and prices).
- Using ".T" function to swap row and columns making an arrays compatible with matrix.

## Array sorting Operations
  - Now, letâ€™s explore some sorting operations:
    - numpy.sort(): Sort an array.
    - numpy.argsort(): Return the indices that would sort an array.
    - numpy.argmax(): Return the index of the maximum value.
    - numpy.argmin(): Return the index of the minimum value.
